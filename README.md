# Maze Solver 

This project was made for the UB Hacking 24 hour hackathon 

This python project will solve any maze with the following restrictions:

* Maze walls are represented by black pixels
* Maze passageways are represented by white pixels
* Maze Entrance and exits must be on the top or bottom and must be the only white pixel there

Mazes were generated with the program called Daedalus found [here.](http://www.astrolog.org/labyrnth/daedalus.htm)

Program contains 4 different mazes of sizes 16 x 16, 128 x 128, 1024 x 1024, and 2048 x 2048. You can also choose your own created mazes but they must follow the restrictions listed above.
You can also choose the paint for the solution path, currently there is only rainbow and a gradient from red to green.
